This repo is outdated, as I have written another example bot that is standalone and doesn't use Scaffolding.


This is an example Bot for Discord using the DSharp+ framework.

It asks the user for a Bot Token, declares the necessary intents for a small bot (you might want to adjust those depending on the use case)
and comes shipped with two example commands (one for slash commands, one for prefix commands).

This bot uses the Scaffolding made by CloudeWolf https://github.com/CloudTheWolf/CloudTheWolf.DSharpPlus.Scaffolding
