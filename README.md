This is an example Bot for Discord using the DSharp+ framework.

It asks the user for a Bot Token, declares the necessary intents for a small bot (you might want to adjust those depending on the use case)
and comes shipped with two example commands (one for slash commands, one for prefix commands).

This bot is made by following the documentation of DSharp+ and is intended to make it easier to write your own bot, as you only have to add your own commands and register them!
